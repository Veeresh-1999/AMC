            <h3>About Us :</h3>
            <p>
               - The great ambition and founding of AMC Institutions were made possible by the 40 years of tirelessly building our heritage in higher education. Our history and ethos—rejecting the existing quo, rethinking instructional strategies, and developing real-world professionals—are our greatest assets. Our carefully thought-out efforts have accelerated our ability to reach major milestones and have fueled successes that are evident in our relationships and alumni success. Our commitment to forward-thinking research, teaching, and societal service is infused with a strong vision.
            </p>
            <p> - The undergraduate and postgraduate programmes offered by AMC College, which is made up of the five constituent departments of commerce and management, computer applications, hotel management, biotechnology, and biochemistry, are centered around a vibrant academic environment that is conducive to learning.</p>

            <p>
                - The faculty, which is made up of a good mix of renowned academicians and business professionals, brings with them a wealth of practical expertise and stellar academic credentials. The curriculum is created to enable our students to make data-driven decisions that are supported by a broad range of subject knowledge, skills, and abilities. Our students have always benefited from our strong emphasis on applied learning with industry inputs and academic rigour since it helps them to expand their horizons, think globally, and adopt an entrepreneurial perspective.
            </p>

            <p>
                - We also think that this is a good time to support entrepreneurship. AMC is aware that creating entrepreneurs involves much more than just academic instruction. We are aware that an entrepreneur does not have a particular personality. To meet this problem, AMC College was founded, fostering an environment where businesspeople may be educated and supported.
            </p>

            <p>
                - The AMC College in Bengaluru offers courses that are totally devoted to fostering entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour on its stunning 52-acre campus.
            </p>

            <p>
                - Students are instilled with a spirit of inquiry by the AMC culture, which motivates a lifetime pursuit of intellectual and personal development. This culture encourages creative thinking and supports the search for novel solutions to challenging societal and business issues.
            </p>
